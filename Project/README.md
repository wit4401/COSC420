# Traveling Salesman Problem using OpenMP

### OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing)
Open Multi-Processing or OpenMP is an API that supports multi-platform shared-memory multiprocessing programming in C++, C, and Fortran, and operable on macOS, Linux, and Windows. OpenMP is typically used for loop-level parallelism making it perfect for the application I have chosen to showoff the functionality of OpenMP with.

### The Parallel Traveling Salesman
The classic Traveling Salesman problem states: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" Using OpenMP we can loop through several senarios of this faster than if no parallelism was involved.
