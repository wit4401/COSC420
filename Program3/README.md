# Program 3: Matrix Operations with CUDA
In mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns. The individual items in a matrix are called its elements or entries. There are a number of matrix operations including matrix addition, multiplication and transposition, and finding the inverse of a matrix, which have many application in scientific computation.  

In this program, you will 

* Implement matrix addition in CUDA 

* Implement matrix multiplication in CUDA 

* Apply performance tuning techniques on matrix multiplication including tiling matrix multiplication kernel using shared memories and multiple blocks of threads 

* Compare matrix multiplication performance using different number of blocks and different sizes of blocks and tiles. Explain the reasons for performance difference. 

* Compare performance difference between sequential and parallel matrix operations. Explain the reasons for performance improvement or degrading.
